            <p><span>If a city is a building, stairs/stoops are furniture inside. As furniture in your home, which can be used in anyways you want, Stair is not only a part of circulation in a building but also a similar social generator to a city. </span></p>
            <p><span>Stairs are different, however, they are all composed of treads and risers, which provide a universal special container hosting different activities. Every day, people are generating stand, sit, listen, touch, exercise, play music, etc. on the stairs. By doing these, people keep leaving memories, thoughts, experiences, and anything on these elements.  </span></p>
            <p><span>This project intends to create a repository for collecting the locations in different cities, and their particular stories about these stairs. </span></p>            
            <p><span>The project name "The Stair Times," imitate the nature of newspaper, which is a live collection of daily news happening in any places around the world.</span></p>
