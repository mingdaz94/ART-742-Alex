            <p><span>Stairs are everywhere, so do stories.</span></p>
            <p><span>-</span></p>
            <p><span>If a city is a building, stairs are furniture inside. Similar to the furniture in your apartment, which can be used in anyways you want; <i>Stair is not only a part of circulation in a building but also a social generator for public. </i></span></p>
            <p><span>Stairs could be very different from each other, however, they are all composed of treads and risers, which provide a universal spatial container hosting different activities. Every day, people stand, sit, listen, touch, exercise, play music, etc. on the stairs. By doing these, people keep creating memories, thoughts, and experiences on these elements.  </span></p>
            <p><span>-</span></p>
            <p><span>This project intends to create a repository for collecting the locations of stairs that people comment in different cities, and their particular stories about these stairs. Not only locations on the map, but people can check out the stree views to look at what the stairs actually looks like.</span></p>            
            <p><span>The project name "The Stair Times," imitates the nature of newspaper, which is a live collection of daily news happening in any places around the world.</span></p>
